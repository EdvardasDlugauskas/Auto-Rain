You can also only download the `force_update.bat` file, put it in a folder, execute it. The needed files will be downloaded in your working directory.

If you'd rather copy and paste your app, .ini, and image save paths, open rain.ini and edit the parameters. Otherwise, press "Change paths", click on the button next to the path you wish to edit - a file selection window will open. Find your desired file and click "Save".
